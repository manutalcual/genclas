Class creation program based in configuration files.

I can't even remember what was the pupose of this tool.

I can remember the project, because it was very interesting and the
company I was working for is on the copyright notice. I know it was a
border control truck with radar and an video camera with extremely
resolution for Spain's Gibraltar strait surveillance.

There I was creating a circular data base to store the last twenty
four hour of video to be able to show to a judge in case of traffic
dealer detention.

I think this tool was to generate code for the distinct events to
store in the database: radar tracks, video and other sensors.

Frankly, I don't remember.
